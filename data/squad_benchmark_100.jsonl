{"title": "Rhine", "context": "The Rhine is the longest river in Germany. It is here that the Rhine encounters some more of its main tributaries, such as the Neckar, the Main and, later, the Moselle, which contributes an average discharge of more than 300 m3/s (11,000 cu ft/s). Northeastern France drains to the Rhine via the Moselle; smaller rivers drain the Vosges and Jura Mountains uplands. Most of Luxembourg and a very small part of Belgium also drain to the Rhine via the Moselle.

{"title": "Force", "context": "It is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force. However, these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.[citation needed] Since electrons are fermions, they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons. When the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states. This means that it takes energy to pack them together. While this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force, it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states.", "qna": [{"question": "What is often misunderstood as the cause of matter rigidity?", "answer": "repulsion of like charges"}, {"question": "What actually causes rigidity in matter?", "answer": "the Pauli exclusion principle"}, {"question": "What is needed to pack electrons densely together?", "answer": "energy"}, {"question": "How is the Pauli exclusion priciple manifested in the macro world?", "answer": "as a structural force"}, {"question": "What is often misunderstood as the cause of matter rigidity?", "answer": "repulsion of like charges"}, {"question": "What actually causes rigidity in matter?", "answer": "the Pauli exclusion principle"}, {"question": "What is needed to pack electrons densely together?", "answer": "energy"}, {"question": "How is the Pauli exclusion priciple manifested in the macro world?", "answer": "as a structural force"}]}
